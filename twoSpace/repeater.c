/*************************************************************************

  Name: repeater
  
  Purpose: The purpose of this program is to modify time difference of
  arrival (TDOA) information necessary for use of the wls program that
  is used for RF emitter location determination.  The position parameters
  have units of feet, and the time parameters have units of nanoseconds.
  It should be noted that only the time difference information is modified.
  All other parameters of the file are unchanged.
  
  Calling Sequence: repeater [-a] [-f] < inputFile >outputFile
  
  Inputs:
  
    a - A flag which indicates that repeater path delay should be added
    to the time differences.  If this flag is not specified, repeater
    path delay will be subtracted from the time differences.
    
    An optional flag (the -f) which indicates that position parameters are
    in feet, otherwise, they are in units of meters.
       
    A text file with the following format:
      n
      xe ye 
      x0 y0 t00
      x1 y1 t01
      x2 y2 t02
        .
	.
      xm-1 ym-1 t0m-1
      	     
      The tuples, [xi yi t0i]:i=0,1,2,...m-1 correspond to the locations
      of receivers, to the differences of time of arrival between the
      reference receiver, located at (x0,y0), and a receiver at location
      (xi,yi). Note that the receiver, located at (x0,y0) is designated
      as the reference receiver for which all time differences are computed.
      The tuple [xe ye] is the initial estimate of the position of the
      emitter.  The value n indicates the number of receivers that were
      used for the collection of measurements      
  
  Outputs:
  
    A text file with the same format as the input file with adjusted
    time differences.
